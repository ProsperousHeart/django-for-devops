# [General & Basic Monitoring with Render](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-django-for-devops-terraform-render-docker-cicd/learn/lecture/49344687#overview)

When you go to your Render web app, on the left hadn side is a section for `MONITOR`. You can filter your logs as well as other things (e.g. timeframe, sorting, etc).

Same with metrics section.
