# django-for-devops
This is the repo I will make as part of my progression through a Udemy course

# Notes to Remember

This comes from [this training](https://www.udemy.com/share/107FCA3@eEZgOBzVh4cfxJVHZypDylXfr0ukjDw_Kk_X553t7XPJ-PHQ0OjD7KOkTXIOruCK/).

You will need to update the `main.tf` file to add the bucket name, GitHub username, etc. This ensures it ties to your specific work and logins. This also applies to the `terraform.yml` in GitHub workflows.

You will also need to update the ENV files.
